## Simple Text Editor (PRS Edit v1.0)

Simple text editor designed for Linux/Unix. I will be designing it also for Windows/OSX, but that will be version 0.2. In other words, the next version (which will use SDL2 for cross-platform).

### Features - So Far

 - Ctrl-Q - exit the editor.
 - Ctrl-S - save file.
 - Ctrl-F - search text for string.
 - Ctrl-K - Delete current line of text.
 - Ctrl-U - Undo last deleted line of text.
